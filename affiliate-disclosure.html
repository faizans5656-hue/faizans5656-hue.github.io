                    <h2>Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
                    <p>
                        The commissions we earn from affiliate partnerships help us run this website and keep our loan calculator 
                        and other tools <strong>free for everyone to use</strong>. These partnerships allow us to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintain and improve our website</li>
                        <li>Keep our calculators and tools free of charge</li>
                        <li>Continue providing helpful financial information and resources</li>
                        <li>Cover the costs of hosting, development, and website maintenance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Without these affiliate partnerships, we would need to charge users for access to our tools or display 
                        more advertisements, which would negatively impact your experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Your decision to use our affiliate links is completely voluntary.</strong> You are under no 
                        obligation to click on any affiliate link or make any purchase through our website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We only recommend products and services that we believe may be helpful to our users. However, you should 
                        always do your own research and make decisions that are best for your individual financial situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you choose to use our affiliate links or find the same products and services through other means, 
                        you will always have full access to our free calculators and tools.

                    <p>
                        We believe in being transparent with our users. That's why we're upfront about our affiliate relationships. 
                        Our goal is to provide you with valuable tools and information, and affiliate partnerships help make that 
                        possible.

                    <ul>
                        <li>We only partner with companies we believe offer quality products or services</li>
                        <li>Our recommendations are based on what we think might be helpful, not just on potential commissions</li>
                        <li>Affiliate commissions do not influence the accuracy of our calculators or the information we provide</li>
                        <li>You will never pay more for a product or service by using our affiliate links</li>
